# Certified Penetration Testing Professional (CPENT) – Study Resources & Labs

**Introduction**
Welcome to the Certified Penetration Testing Professional (CPENT) repository — a comprehensive resource hub designed for cybersecurity professionals, ethical hackers, and penetration testers preparing for the CPENT certification. This repository provides a structured and practical approach to mastering advanced penetration testing concepts through detailed study materials, hands-on labs, scenario-based challenges, and curated references aligned with the official CPENT exam blueprint.

The CPENT certification is an advanced-level credential that validates a professional’s ability to perform complex penetration tests in enterprise environments. It emphasizes real-world, hands-on experience across a diverse range of systems — from traditional IT networks to IoT, OT, cloud, and hybrid infrastructures. Unlike multiple-choice exams, the CPENT exam is entirely scenario-driven, conducted in a live cyber range environment where candidates must exploit, pivot, and defend within a 24-hour assessment period.

This certification bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, equipping you with the skills to identify, exploit, and report vulnerabilities ethically and professionally. Candidates who demonstrate exceptional performance may also earn the Licensed Penetration Tester (LPT Master) credential, showcasing elite-level expertise in offensive security.

**About This Repository**

This repository serves as a complete learning companion for anyone pursuing the CPENT certification or looking to deepen their understanding of advanced penetration testing methodologies. It is structured to promote a learn-by-doing approach, integrating study materials, practice labs, scripts, and scenario walkthroughs that mirror real-world pentesting engagements.
